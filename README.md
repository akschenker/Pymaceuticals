# Pymaceuticals

This was a homework assignment for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics bootcamp. For this assignment, we were tasked to analyze the data from a drug trial on mice, focusing on the effects of four conditions: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and placebo. We examined the effects of these drugs on tumor growth, metastatic spread, and survival rates across the 45-day study.
